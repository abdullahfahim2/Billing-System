This Python script implements a simple billing system without a graphical user interface (GUI). It allows users to input customer details and items purchased, and generates a bill voucher displaying the items purchased along with the total amount.

## Features

- **Item Management:** Users can input details of items purchased, including item name and price.
- **Bill Generation:** The script generates a bill voucher displaying the customer's name, address, items purchased, and total amount.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** The script provides a simple text-based interface for inputting customer details and item information.

## Usage

1. Run the Python script `billing_system.py`.
2. Input the customer's name, address, and the number of items purchased.
3. For each item, input the item name and price.
4. Once all item details are entered, the script will generate a bill voucher displaying the details of the purchase.

## Example

Here's an example of how to use the billing system:    


Hello Everyone. Welcome to Our Grocery Management System!......    

Enter your name: John Doe<br>
Enter your address: 123 Main Street, Cityville  
Enter total items: 3   
<br>
Enter item name: Milk<br>
Enter price: 2<br>
